# Unnecessary documentation in the image (if plan.md is in C2RPM)
# If plan.md is at the root of the project, and C2RPM is a sub-folder,
# and the build context is the root, then C2RPM/plan.md will be copied
# by COPY C2RPM/ ./ in /app. If we do not want plan.md in the image:
# C2RPM/plan.md
# However, the plan.md provided in the initial list is in C2RPM/plan.md
# and the Dockerfile is at the root, so it will be copied under C2RPM/plan.md IN the image.
# To exclude it:
C2RPM/plan.md


# Example data files that are copied by the entrypoint from the image
# but that we may not want directly in the WORKDIR if others
# copies are more specific. Currently, they are needed in /app
# for entrypoint.sh to work (eg: DEFAULT_PREFS_PATH="${FLASK_APP_DIR}/preferences.json")
# So do not ignore them here if the copy strategy remains the same.
